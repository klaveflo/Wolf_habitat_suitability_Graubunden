abstract = {In recent years, the European wolf (Canis lupus) population has expanded its southern range from the Italian Peninsula to the Maritime Alps (Italy and France) and to Piemonte (Italy); establishing small sub-populations. Hence re-colonisation of the Swiss Alps is now likely to occur. In 1995–1996 the wolf reached the southern part of Switzerland (Canton of Valais) from where he got extinct 150 years ago. Actual conflicts of interests between livestock breeders, local political authorities and nature conservation parties, as well as federal authorities defending the protected status of wolf, require serious management investigations. In order to check wolf habitat suitability of an alpine landscape, like the Valais, subjected to dynamic landscape–ecology processes since the extinction of wolf, we present herein an application of a predictive wolf habitat model, using a stochastic model involving logistic regression. As no data were available in the Canton of Valais, the regression coefficients for the retained variables such as urban area, population density, arable land, minimal altitude, northwest exposure and wild ungulate diversity index, were derived from data collected in the northern Apennine (Northern Italy), where habitat variables were related to data of wolf presence. The selection of the parameters for the Canton of Valais has been performed in respect of their predictive power, as well as their availability and geo-morphological importance for the alpine landscape under consideration. Using the geographic information system (GIS), the simulation pointed out that 19% (1142km2) of the total grid surface (5821km2) are suitable for wolf presence. Moreover, it reveals that especially areas at lower altitudes (minimum altitude<800–900ma.s.l.), due to the high anthropic activity, and areas at high altitudes (minimum altitude>1800–2000m a.s.l.), due to lack of prey and severe geo-morphological conditions, present a reduced habitat suitability. The geomorphological and demographic situation of the alpine area lead to a wolf habitat of a partially fragmented and linear aspect, affecting overall habitat suitability. The strengths of the application is not only the visualisation of the present habitat quality of an alpine landscape re-colonised by wolves, but also that it allows to make investigations in order to manage the different conflicts of interest.}

abstract = {Abstract The central-European population of wolves Canis lupus has its western border of contiguous range in eastern Poland. Protected since 1998, Polish wolves began to expand towards the west. Based on large-scale data on wolf abundance (2000–2006) and geographic information system (GIS) tools, we built a habitat suitability model (HSM) for the species in Poland. The best model, selected by the Akaike information criterion, of the resource selection function (RSF) by wolves included percentage cover of forests, meadows and marshes (positively correlated to wolf abundance) and road density (negatively correlated), and explained 53\% of the total variation in the wolf abundance index in a 10 × 10 km cell grid. That RSF was then used to evaluate the whole country in terms of suitability for wolves. Potential wolf range appeared to consist of 24 patches of good habitat (predicted relative probability of wolf occurrence ≥30\%), including six patches already occupied and 17 new ones. In total, habitat suitable for wolves covers at least 20–24\% of Poland, compared with 16\% of the country's area now occupied by the species. HSM was validated with historical data on wolf occurrence in 1950–2006. The areas selected by our model and those inhabited by wolves in at least one decade overlapped in 81–86\%. Furthermore, the probability of wolf occurrence predicted by the model correlated positively with the number of decades the wolves were actually recorded in the area. Based on the empirical relationship between patch size and wolf numbers, we estimated that Poland could support a population of 1450–1540 wolves, two to three times larger than the current estimate. HSM needs to be supplemented with a GIS-based connectivity analysis among patches, which in turn should be validated by molecular genetics studies on dispersing wolves. Because of broadly similar geographic conditions, the model may be applicable to eastern Germany, Belarus Republic and the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia).},

abstract = {The expansion of the wolf population all over Europe has posed problems on wolf-man coexistence in those areas where the wolf was not present for a long time. Breeding activities are now threatened by high predation on livestock. We investigated the relationship between wolf and its habitat, in order to evaluate wolf habitat suitability and to predict its presence. The study areas covered 3289 km2. A 23 km2 grid was used to identify 143 sample squares. For each sample square 58 habitat variables were measured from land-use (1:25 000), and from topographical maps. Wolf presence (4 classes) was assessed by scat collection, direct observations, snow tracking, wolf-howling, and predation records. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were carried out to investigate the influence of habitat features on wolf presence. The habitat suitability model was based on two different equations: a dichotomous logistic regression model, and a polytomous one. The first one discriminated between suitable and unsuitable habitats, and its predictions were confirmed in 93\% of grouped cases; the second provided predicted values of wolf presence that were concordant with the observed response levels in 82.5\% of contrasts. Both models underlined the importance of three factors in determining wolf habitat suitability: wild prey abundance, human presence and forest cover.},

abstract = {The wolf is naturally recolonizing the Alpine range. Potentially, eight different countries are affected, clearly calling for transboundary management planning. In this framework, using the partitioned Mahalanobis distance, and considering environmental, anthropogenic, and biotic variables, we produced a model of the potential distribution of the wolf over the Alpine range, accounting for the ecological characteristics of the species and for the lack of equilibrium in the current distribution. Low human population density, increasing distance from infrastructures, intermediate elevations and high prey-species richness were the most important factors in predicting wolf presence, followed by the presence of natural land-covers. Based on the projections of our model, we predicted a large availability of high suitability areas across the entire alpine range, which promises great potential for wolf range expansion in the near future. Moreover, protected areas cover 47% of the high suitability areas, and many may act in the future as source habitat patches across the entire alpine region. Our model provides a useful planning tool to develop, evaluate and implement transboundary conservation and management interventions at a broad, biologically meaningful scale across the entire Alpine range. By depicting the potential species distribution in the Alps, our model will aid regional and local managers to design proactive approaches to wolf conservation, especially in areas that have not yet been colonized by the species.}

abstract = {Abstract Aim  Understanding which human or environmental factors interact to enable or to limit the occurrence and persistence of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes is an important issue for their effective conservation, especially under the current scenario of global change where most of their former habitat is being transformed by humans. Location  NW Iberian Peninsula. Methods  We combine data on the distribution of Iberian wolves (Canis lupus signatus) living in a human-dominated landscape in NW Spain and variation and partitioning methods to investigate the relative importance of three groups of predictors: food availability, humans and landscape attributes – each group expected to have unequal effects on wolf reproduction and survival – and their interactions on the occurrence of this species. Results  We found that the group of predictors related with landscape attributes (altitude, roughness and refuge) strongly determined wolf occurrence, followed by humans and food availability. Variance partitioning analysis revealed that the three most important components determining wolf occurrence were related with landscape attributes: (1) the joint effects of the three predictor groups, (2) the joint effect of humans and landscape attributes and (3) the pure effect of landscape attributes. Altitude had the main independent contribution to explain the probability of wolf occurrence. Main conclusions  In human-dominated landscapes, the occurrence of wolves is the result of a complex interaction among several environmental and human factors. Our results suggest that the characteristics of the landscape (spatial context) – factors associated with the security of wolves facilitating that animals go unnoticed by humans, wolf movements, dispersal events and short-time colonization – become more important in human-dominated landscapes and may have played a key role in the occurrence and persistence of this species throughout decades modulating the relationship between humans and wolf distribution.},
